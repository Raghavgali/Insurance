  "report": "**Damage Report:**\n\n**Vehicle Make/Model:** Not specified (based on the visible portion)\n\n**Damage Description:**\n\n1. **Front Fender Damage:**\n   - The front fender appears to be significantly damaged. There is a large gap where the fender has been removed or is missing entirely. This exposes the inner components of the wheel well.\n   - The area around the wheel well shows signs of rust and wear, indicating that the fender was likely removed for some time before being replaced.\n\n2. **Tire Damage:**\n   - The tire is flat and appears to have been removed from the vehicle. It is lying on the ground outside the wheel well.\n   - The rim of the tire is intact but shows signs of rust and wear, which could indicate that the tire was not properly maintained.\n\n3. **Wheels/Rims:**\n   - The wheels/rims appear to be in good condition with no visible cracks or major dents. However, they show signs of rust, which may be related to the prolonged exposure caused by the missing fender.\n\n4. **Other Visible Damage:**\n   - The vehicle's body paint is chipped and worn in several areas, particularly near the wheel well and along the lower side panel.\n   - There is a visible exhaust pipe on the left side, which seems to be in good condition without any apparent damage.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe vehicle has sustained significant damage to the front fender, which has been removed, exposing the wheel well and causing rust and wear. The tire is flat and missing, and the wheels/rims show signs of rust. The body paint is also chipped and worn in several areas. No other major structural damage is observed.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Replace the missing fender and repair the exposed wheel well.\n- Replace the flat tire and ensure proper maintenance of the wheels/rims.\n- Address the chipped and worn body paint as part of the overall repair process.\n\nPlease note that this assessment is based on the visible portion of the vehicle. Further inspection may be required to determine if there are additional damages not visible in the provided image."
