  "report": "**Damage Report:**\n\n**Vehicle Make/Model:** Not specified (only the rear end is visible).\n\n**Location of Damage:** The rear bumper of the vehicle.\n\n**Type of Damage:**\n- **Crack/Scratch:** There is a noticeable crack or scratch running across the rear bumper, starting from the lower left side near the taillight and extending towards the center. The paint appears to be chipped and damaged in this area.\n- **Paint Damage:** The paint around the crack is chipped, revealing the underlying material. This suggests that the impact was significant enough to cause both the crack and the paint damage.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The taillight appears to be intact with no signs of damage.\n- The surrounding area of the rear bumper shows some minor scuff marks, which could indicate prior minor impacts but do not appear to be as severe as the main crack.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nThe rear bumper requires repair to address the crack and the associated paint damage. It may also be necessary to inspect the structural integrity of the bumper to ensure it has not been compromised by the impact.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Schedule an appointment with a body shop to assess the extent of the damage and provide an estimate for repairs.\n- Document the damage thoroughly for insurance purposes, including photos and a detailed description.\n\nIf you need further information or have additional questions, feel free to ask!"
