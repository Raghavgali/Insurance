  "report": "**Damage Report:**\n\n**Vehicle Make/Model:** Not specified (only the wheel and part of the body are visible).\n\n**Location of Damage:**\n- **Front Left Wheel:** The tire appears to be flat or significantly underinflated, as indicated by the lack of tension in the tire's shape. There is no visible puncture or damage to the tire itself, but the condition suggests it may need air pressure.\n\n**Type of Damage:**\n- **Flat Tire:** The tire is not inflated properly, which could lead to further damage if driven on with low pressure.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- No other visible damage to the car's bodywork or other components is apparent from this image.\n- It is recommended that the tire be checked for proper inflation and any potential issues such as a puncture or internal damage.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe primary damage observed is a flat tire on the front left side of the vehicle. No other significant damage is noted."
