This may involve sanding down the damaged areas, applying primer, and then repainting the fender to match the existing paint color.\n- It is advisable to inspect the rest of the vehicle for any additional hidden damage before finalizing the repair plan.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe vehicle has sustained damage to the fender, which requires attention for proper repair. Further inspection of the vehicle is recommended to ensure no other unseen damage exists."
