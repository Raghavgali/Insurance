  "report": "**Damage Report:**\n\n**Vehicle Make/Model:** Not specified (only the wheel well area is visible).\n\n**Location of Damage:**\n- The image shows the wheel well area of the vehicle.\n- There appears to be significant damage to the fender liner and the surrounding body panel.\n- The fender liner has been torn or peeled away from the body, exposing the inner structure of the wheel well.\n- The body panel near the wheel well also shows signs of damage, with scratches and possibly some paint chipping.\n\n**Type of Damage:**\n- The damage seems to be consistent with a collision or impact that caused the fender liner to tear and the body panel to sustain scratches and paint damage.\n- The exposed inner structure suggests that the damage might have been severe enough to cause internal damage as well, though it's not possible to determine the extent without further inspection.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- It is recommended that a thorough inspection of the entire vehicle be conducted to assess the full extent of the damage, including any potential internal damage.\n- The vehicle should be repaired by a qualified mechanic to ensure safety and proper functionality.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The tire and wheel appear to be in good condition and do not show any visible signs of damage.\n- Further inspection may be necessary to confirm the extent of the damage and to identify any other areas that may need attention.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is visible damage to the fender liner and body panel in the wheel well area. Further inspection is required to determine the full extent of the damage."
