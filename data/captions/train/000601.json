  "report": "**Damage Report:**\n\n**Vehicle Make/Model:** Not specified (only the wheel area is visible).\n\n**Location of Damage:**\n- **Front Right Wheel:** The tire appears to be flat or significantly underinflated, as indicated by the deflated appearance and the lack of tension in the tire's shape.\n- **Rim:** The rim looks worn and possibly damaged, with signs of rust or corrosion around the hub area.\n\n**Type of Damage:**\n- **Flat Tire:** The tire is not inflated, which could be due to a puncture, slow leak, or other issues that have caused it to lose air pressure.\n- **Worn Rim:** The rim shows signs of wear and potential structural damage, which may affect its ability to hold the tire securely.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The condition of the fender and surrounding bodywork does not appear to show any significant damage.\n- Further inspection would be necessary to determine if the tire has been driven on while flat, which could lead to additional damage to the wheel and potentially the suspension components.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Replace the flat tire immediately to prevent further damage to the wheel and ensure safe driving conditions.\n- Inspect the wheel and rim for any structural damage and replace them if necessary.\n- Have the vehicle towed to a repair shop for a thorough inspection and repair if required.\n\n**Signature:**\n[Your Name]  \nInsurance Adjuster"
