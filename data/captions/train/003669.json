There is a noticeable crack running along the edge of the fender, extending from the lower part near the bumper to the upper portion where it meets the tail light assembly.\n\n**Type of Damage:**\nThe damage appears to be a structural crack, likely caused by an impact or collision. The crack is deep and runs through the metal, indicating that the fender panel has been compromised. There are also some minor scratches and dents visible on the surface around the crack, suggesting that the impact was not localized but rather spread across a larger area.\n\n**Additional Observations:**\n- The paint on the fender is intact but may need touch-up due to the scratches.\n- No other visible damage is noted on the rear fender or surrounding areas.\n- The tail light assembly appears undamaged.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nGiven the extent of the damage, it is recommended that the rear fender be repaired professionally. This will involve removing the damaged section, repairing the underlying structure, and reapplying the fender panel. Touch-up paint may also be necessary to restore the vehicle's appearance.\n\n**Signature:**\n[Your Name]  \nInsurance Adjuster\n\n---\n\nPlease note that this report is based on the information provided in the image.
