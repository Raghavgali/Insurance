It looks like it could have been caused by a curb or another object scraping against the vehicle.\n\n**Description:**\n- The scratch is linear and extends from the lower part of the fender towards the rear corner. The depth and width of the scratch suggest that it may have penetrated the paint layer but not necessarily the underlying metal.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Based on the visual inspection, the damage seems superficial and does not appear to compromise the structural integrity of the vehicle. However, it would be advisable to have a professional assessment to determine if any underlying damage exists beneath the surface.\n\n**Photographic Evidence:**\n- A photograph has been attached showing the extent of the damage.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- There is visible damage to the vehicle as described above. Further inspection by a qualified mechanic or body shop is recommended to assess the full extent of the damage and determine the appropriate course of action.\n\n**Prepared By:**\n[Your Name]  \nInsurance Adjuster  \n[Your Company Name]  \n[Contact Information]  \n\n**Attachments:**\n- Photograph of the damage (attached)\n\n**End of Report**"
