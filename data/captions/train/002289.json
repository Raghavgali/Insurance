  "report": "**Damage Report:**\n\n**Vehicle Make/Model:** Not specified (only the rear portion of the vehicle is visible).\n\n**Location of Damage:** The rear fender of the vehicle.\n\n**Type of Damage:** The rear fender has significant damage, with large areas of the paintwork chipped away, revealing the underlying metal. There appears to be a substantial dent or impact that has caused the paint to peel off in large sections. The damage seems to be concentrated on the lower part of the rear fender near the wheel well.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The damage looks like it could have been caused by a collision or a heavy impact.\n- The exposed metal suggests that the structural integrity of the fender may also be compromised.\n- Further inspection would be necessary to determine if there are any underlying structural issues or additional damage to other parts of the vehicle.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- The vehicle should be towed to a repair shop for a thorough inspection and repair.\n- The cost of repairs will depend on the extent of the damage and the specific repairs required.\n\n**Signature:**\n[Your Name]  \nInsurance Adjuster"
