  "report": "**Damage Report:**\n\n**Vehicle Make/Model:** Not specified (only the wheel and part of the fender are visible).\n\n**Location of Damage:**\n- **Fender:** The red fender has significant damage at the front, with a large portion of it missing or broken off. This exposes the inner structure of the car.\n- **Wheel:** The wheel appears to be intact but is positioned incorrectly, as if it has been removed from the vehicle. The tire looks worn and possibly damaged.\n\n**Type of Damage:**\n- **Fender:** The damage to the fender seems to be structural, likely caused by a collision or impact that resulted in the detachment of a large section of the fender.\n- **Wheel:** The wheel is not properly installed on the vehicle, which could indicate that it was removed due to damage or for repair purposes. The tire's condition suggests wear and potential damage, though it\u2019s unclear whether this is related to the fender damage.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The exposed area under the fender shows some rust, indicating that the vehicle may have been exposed to moisture or environmental factors before the incident.\n- There are no visible signs of recent impact or damage to the wheel itself, apart from the possibility of wear.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe vehicle has sustained significant damage to the fender, which requires immediate attention. The wheel is not currently installed, so its condition cannot be assessed without proper installation. Further inspection and documentation are recommended to determine the extent of the damage and the cause of the incident."
