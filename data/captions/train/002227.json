The area affected shows a loss of paint with some underlying metal exposed, indicating that the damage has penetrated through the paint layer but not yet reached the body structure.\n\n**Description:**\nThe scratch/chip is approximately 2 inches long and 1 inch wide. It is located towards the lower portion of the rear fender, close to where the taillight meets the body.

This will ensure that the paint job is done correctly and matches the rest of the vehicle's finish.\n\n**Photographic Evidence:**\nA photograph of the damage is attached for reference.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is visible damage to the vehicle as described above. Further inspection may be necessary if additional damage is found during the repair process.\n\n**Prepared By:**\n[Your Name]  \nInsurance Adjuster  \n[Your Company Name]  \n[Contact Information]  \n\n---\n\n**Attachments:**\n- Photograph of the damage (attached)\n\n**End of Report**"
