  "report": "**Damage Report:**\n\n**Vehicle:** Blue SUV\n\n**Location of Damage:** Rear Right Wheel\n\n**Type of Damage:** The rear right wheel appears to be damaged. The tire has been punctured or otherwise compromised, as evidenced by the exposed rim and the lack of tread on the tire. The tire is not properly inflated, and it seems to be leaning against the curb, which could indicate that it was driven with the flat tire.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vehicle is parked on a curb, which may have contributed to the tire's position.\n- There is no visible damage to the body of the vehicle itself, but the condition of the tire suggests that the vehicle should not be driven until the tire is replaced.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Replace the rear right tire immediately to ensure safe operation of the vehicle.\n- Inspect the other tires for any signs of wear or damage before driving the vehicle again.\n\n**Prepared By:** [Your Name]  \n**Date:** [Today's Date]"
