The scratch is relatively shallow but is visible upon close inspection.\n\n**Type of Damage:**\nThe damage appears to be a superficial scratch rather than a deeper dent or impact damage. There are no signs of paint chipping or any other significant structural damage.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe rear bumper of the vehicle has sustained a scratch. This damage can typically be repaired with minor touch-up work, such as sanding and repainting the affected area.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nIt is recommended that the vehicle undergo a professional inspection by a repair shop to assess the extent of the damage and provide an accurate estimate for repairs. If the scratch is minor, it may be possible to repair it without removing the bumper, but if it extends into the structural components, the bumper may need to be replaced.\n\n**Prepared By:**\n[Your Name]  \nInsurance Adjuster  \n[Your Company]  \n[Date]"
