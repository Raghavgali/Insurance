No structural damage is apparent. The damage is consistent with typical wear and tear and does not appear to be severe enough to warrant extensive repairs.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Inspect the area further for any underlying damage (e.g., dents).\n- If the scratches are deep or widespread, consider touch-up paint to restore the vehicle's appearance.\n- If the scratches are minor and do not affect the structural integrity, no further action may be necessary.\n\n**Prepared By:**\n[Your Name]\nInsurance Adjuster\n\n**Company:**\n[Your Company Name]"
